### Why the name “in-toto”?

in-toto is Latin for "as a whole." We chose the name because our objective with
in-toto is to build a system to protect the whole software supply chain.

### What is the difference between in-toto and The Update Framework?

[The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io) (TUF) provides a framework
that can be used to secure update systems, i.e. the "last mile," whereas in-toto
lets you verify the whole software supply chain. TUF and in-toto can play
together very well, as you can use TUF to deliver updates and their
corresponding in-toto metadata.

### Is Python 3 supported?

Yes, Python 3 is supported with in-toto.

### Is there a timeline for the support of Python 2.7?

We have released the final version of in-toto, v1.0.1, that supports Python 2.
Our next release, at the end of April 2021, will drop support for Python 2.
