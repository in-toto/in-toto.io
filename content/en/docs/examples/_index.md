- [Debian](debian/) — This demo metadata shows how the Debian project could use
  in-toto to secure their version of the grep package.
- [Seattle](seattle/) — Seattle is a fog computing platform that already ships
  in-toto metadata with their releases. Here, you can see a pretty-printed
  version of the seattle metadata.
- [PPH](polypasswordhasher/) — [PolyPasswordHasher](https://pph.io/) is a
  password hashing scheme that prevents an attacker from cracking passwords
  individually and efficiently.
